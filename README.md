# Telugu Bhagavatam Scraper
______

My father asked me if there was a way to scrape the text of the [Bhagavatam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana)
from the website [telugubhagavatam.org](https://telugubhagavatam.org/) so he could read it offline.
I figured this would be a good way to brush up on my web scraping skills. The result is this repository, which contains
a full [HTML version](bhagavatam.html) and a full [PDF version](bhagavatam.pdf) of the Bhagavatam. Individual chapters
are available in the [html](html) and [pdf](pdf) folders. Code is licensed MIT.
